/*the Mandelbrot Set is graphed onto the complex plane.  That means that the point at (-1,2) is given the "c" value -1+2i, where i is the imaginary solution to âˆš-1.
 *every point is given its "c" value and is put through a test:
   *set the universal variable "z" to zero.
        -"c" is different for each point but stays constant throughout the test
        -"z" is what changes throughout the test.
   *set z = z^2 + c. that means squaring zero at first, of course.
   *do it again: z = z^2 + c.
   *and again:   z = z^2 + c.
   *do that an infinite number of times. z will either shoot off to infinity or cycle around near zero forever.
   *if the c-value doesn't make z shoot off to infinity, color the point white.
   *all the rest of the points are left dark.
 
 *the computer can't really do the equation an infinite number of times, so we have a shortcut that makes it easier and even makes it more beautiful.
  *the program simply does the calculation about 20 times per point.  Most of the failing points are eliminated after 20 iterations, anyway.
  *but after each iteration, we see if the point's z-value has already exceeded some boundary.
    matheatically speaking, if the absolute value of z exceeds 2, z will shoot off from there.  That will tell us it diverges to infinity.
  *if a point fails the test, we will color it in.  The color depends on how many iterations before it passed the boundary.
  *this gives us an awesome rainbow effect, radiating around the passing points.
  *all the points that don't fail after 16 iterations are left blank.
  
 *It's called the Mandelbrot Set after Benoit Mandelbrot...
  ...who did tons of research on it.
  *called "set" because it's the set of complex numbers that passes the test.
 *First drawn by Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski in 1978
 (source: Wikipedia)
 
 *It's a fractal because no matter how much you zoom, it gets more detailed.
 *Actually, its border is by definition the most fractal-like it is possible to be.
  *the border's Hausdorff dimension is 2, one more than its intuitive dimension.
  *so, mathematically, the one-dimensional border acts two-dimensional!
  
 *Technically, the Mandelbrot set is a slice of a four-dimensional fractal.
 *Nobody has bothered to try drawing the four-dimensional fractal.
 *of course, that's because you can't really draw things in the fourth dimension... also, it would take huge computing power to calculate its shape in full.
 *other slices of this "Mother Fractal" are called Julia sets.
  *There are many Julia Sets, each one having a universally set "c" value for every point.
  *Each point's coordinates are plugged into z's intitial value instead of into c.
